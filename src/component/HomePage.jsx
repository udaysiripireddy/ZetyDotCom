                While we tried to cover as many professions as possible to ensure you will always find the sample resume you need, there’s a chance that your specific job isn’t on our list. If that’s the case, we encourage you to read our guide on the general resume, where you will learn how to write a more universal document.

                <h2>Can Zety review my resume when I’ve finished making it?</h2>
                <p>
                  The Zety Resume Maker includes a very useful and popular feature called Resume Check. Throughout the resume making
                  process, our software will read your document and compare it against all other similar resumes in our database, in
                  real-time. Not only will you know where your resume might be under-optimized, but our resume check tool will also
                  give you a quality score and specific tips on what to improve.

                  All of Zety’s templates, be it for resumes, CVs, or cover letters, are ATS-compliant. You can safely send the resume you’ve made
                  with Zety to any company, anywhere, and the Applicant Tracking Systems will be able to read and understand your documents.

                <h2>Which resume template should I use in 2024?</h2>
                <p>
                  Zety only offers Modern Resume Templates. They are all available in dozens of color schemes, and you can customize
                  their structure, fonts, margins, and so on. A resume template should be easy to fill in and real, while eye-catching.
                  At Zety, we have carefully crafted every single of our templates to make sure they match both the recruiters’ and the
                  candidates’ preferences. For more details, read our article describing what a resume should look like in 2024.

                  Every change you make in the resume will automatically adjust the contents of your document for you, so you never have
                  to worry about breaking anything.

                <h2>Why do I need a different resume for every job application?</h2>
                <p>
                  Recruiters and hiring managers typically receive hundreds of applications per day. To filter out all the applications
                  that do not meet their needs, they use application tracking software that eliminates all resumes that are not tailored
                  for specific keywords included in the job ad. But even without ATS apps, they can quickly differentiate a generic
                  resume copy-pasted and sent to every single company around from a resume tailored to their job ad.

                  That’s why in your resume, you have to highlight skills and experiences which directly address the company’s needs
                  listed in the job description. To make the cut, you have to send a different resume every time.

                  In the Zety online resume maker you can quickly duplicate your resume and adjust it to a specific job title in a few clicks!

                <h2>Should I download my new resume in PDF or Word?</h2>
                <p>
                  With Zety, you can make a resume for free, and download it in the format of your choice. The most common formats
                  for a resume are PDF and Word. Always opt for the PDF resume if you are sending your document right away. It will
                  ensure your resume layout remains intact on any device and software. Download your resume in Word if you want to have
                  a copy of it that you can edit later.

                  Note that with your Zety account, you can keep as many copies of your resume as you need online, enabling you to update or edit
                  it for another job application, anytime & anywhere. For more information, read about Word VS PDF resume formats

                <h2>Do I need a cover letter for my resume?</h2>
                <p>
                  Yes, you need a cover letter for your resume. Despite what many candidates believe, a cover letter is still necessary in 2024.
                  In this document, you can elaborate on your skills and work experience listed in the resume. It is the best way to complement your
                  resume and provide details of your achievements and abilities. Besides, attaching a covering letter to your job application is a
                  great sign of your motivation to get the job. Even if you’ve never written one in the past, you can still do it quickly. Read our
                  guide on how to write a cover letter, check our dozens of free cover letter examples, or
