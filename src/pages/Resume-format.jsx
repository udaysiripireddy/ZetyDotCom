          <p>Want to know more about writing a resume? Here’s a great guide to get you started: How to Write a Resume</p>
        </div>




        <h3 style={{ marginLeft: "200px" }}>What Is the Best Resume Format?</h3>
        <p>There are three standard resume formats: chronological, which focuses on work experience; functional, which emphasizes skills; and combination, which highlights both. The best and most common format is the chronological one, favored by recruiters for its clear layout and comprehensive overview.</p>

        <p>Here’s what Milena Makowska, Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist, has to say about this resume format:</p>
        <br />
        <p>Think about it: an average job opening attracts hundreds of resumes. If you follow a specific resume format, you will make HR’s job much more manageable.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Many of us consider chronological resumes as our go-to resume format. We know it best; it’s easy to scan, and we can see what you’ve been up to most recently. Usually, this information is the most relevant, and it helps us base our decision on what to do with your resume next.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, you should always choose your resume format according to your work history. It should serve you as a candidate, not me as an HR specialist or the company you’re applying for.</p>
        <p>Just like Milena said, choose a resume format that works best for you as a job seeker. Consider your professional history and then make an informed decision about the type of resume you will write. It’s important to tailor your resume to the job offer, but better to stick to one resume format for all applications. </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginLeft: "200px" }}>Which Resume Format to Choose?</h3>
        <p>Choosing the right resume format depends on your professional experience. In the following chapters, I'll dive into each format in detail. If you need a quick summary, here are some bullet points to help you decide which resume format is best for you.</p>
        <h4>What Is the Best Resume Format for Me?</h4>
        <p>To determine the best resume format for you, consider the following options:</p>
        <p>Chronological resume format is perfect for you if:</p>
        <p>• You’re looking for a job in your industry in which you have lots of experience. </p>
        <p>• Your career progress was steady and within one industry.</p>
        <p>• You have no employment gaps.</p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>You want to have the most common resume format that recruiters of all industries prefer.</p>
        <br />
        <div className='ul'>
          <p>Functional resume format is perfect for you if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You’re looking for a creative gig where your portfolio of projects and a broad skill set are more important than your work history. </li>
            <li>You want to transfer to a new industry, highlight specific skills, or don't have relevant work experience.  </li>
            <li>You're either a creative worker, an overqualified candidate, a veteran, a freelancer, or a first-time job seeker. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <p>Combination resume format is perfect for you if:</p>
          <li>You’re looking for a creative gig where your portfolio of projects and a broad skill set are more important than your work history. </li>
          <li>You want to transfer to a new industry, highlight specific skills, or don't have relevant work experience.  </li>
          <li>You're either a creative worker, an overqualified candidate, a veteran, a freelancer, or a first-time job seeker. </li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>Now, let me explain each format in detail and show you real-life examples</p>
        <div className='pro-tip'>
          <p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: As many as 7 out of 10 large companies use the Applicant Tracking System resume checker. Choosing a good resume template and a suitable resume format is only your first step in creating an ATS-friendly resume. Using specific resume keywords, selecting proper resume fonts, and labeling resume sections with headings will help you pass that test.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <h3 style={{ marginLeft: "200px" }}>Chronological Resume Format</h3>

        <p>The chronological resume (also known as the reverse-chronological resume) highlights your relevant work experience, starting with the most recent one. You continue to list your positions and achievements going backward, placing them in reverse chronological order.</p>
        <p>Let’s see what it looks like.</p>
        <h4>Chronological Resume Format: Text Example</h4>
        <p>Here’s an example of a chronological resume created in our online resume builder:</p>

        <strong>Let’s find out how to structure a reverse-chronological resume.</strong>
        <h4>Chronological Resume Format: Structure</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Resume Header</li>
          <li>Resume Profile (Resume Summary or Career Objective)</li>
          <li>Work Experience</li>
          <li>Education</li>
          <li>Skills</li>
          <li>Additional Information</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These 6 sections form a complete document that will make recruiters’ jobs easier. They’re familiar with this resume layout, which helps them spot all relevant information within 7.4 seconds of looking at a resume. On the other hand, you need to put some extra effort into making your resume stand out from the other candidates.</p>
        <strong>Let’s see some simple resume tips to help you get noticed and impress recruiters even more.</strong>
        <h4>Chronological Resume Format: Formatting Tips</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>List your relevant achievements (not only responsibilities) in your work experience section. That way, you'll show your career progress and your uniqueness.</li>
          <li>Follow the reverse chronological order in your education section as well. List only your highest level of schooling if you have a few years of relevant work experience.</li>
          <li>Highlight your key skills. But don’t just list them. Make them mirror your quantifiable work achievements and adapt them to the job ad.</li>
          <li>Include some additional sections that might be useful for proving your skills. Give them context to make your recruiter realize how much value you’ll bring to the company.</li>
          <li>Write your resume profile last, but place it on the top of your document. Select 2–3 accomplishments and skills from your resume that are most relevant to the job ad. </li>

        </ul>
        <h4>When Is a Chronological Resume Format Good For You?</h4>
        <p>This resume format is perfect for candidates with several years of professional experience who have progressed steadily and preferably in one industry. It’s also great for those with no significant gap in their employment.</p>
        <p>However, following the chronological resume order is very universal. And therefore this resume format works also if you don’t have much experience. For example, if you’re writing a student resume, all you have to do is rearrange your resume sections a bit.</p>
        <p>That being said, whether you’re writing an accounting resume, an IT manager resume, a nurse resume, a law student resume, or any other resume, this format might work out.</p>

        <h3 style={{ marginLeft: "200px" }}>Functional Resume Format</h3>
        <p>The functional resume format, also called a skill-based resume, showcases transferable skills over work history. Its purpose is to disguise having little experience. With this resume format, you list your relevant skills, emphasizing how you’ve practically used them in the past.</p>
        <p>This resume format will work well for creative jobs where a portfolio matters most, military transitioners, and candidates who don't want to seem overqualified.</p>
        <strong>Let’s take a look at the sample.</strong>

        </div>

        <p>The skills summary is the most important section of this resume format. But you still need more than that to impress your recruiter.</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Functional Resume Format: Formatting Tips</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Write a career objective explaining your professional goals. Include your skills and qualifications and add a link to your online portfolio, a blog, or a personal website.</li>
          <li>Pick 4 to 5 hard and soft skills relevant to the job you’re after. Give examples of when and how you applied them. Use either bullet points or go for plain paragraphs.</li>
          <li>List additional skills. They can include your language skills, software you’re proficient in, tools you’re familiar with, etc.</li>
          <li>Add an education section. Your alma mater name and date of your graduation should be enough; however, if you have some relevant coursework, include it as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>When Is a Functional Resume Format Good For You?</h4>
        <p>While the previous resume format seems to work for all, this one is more specific. Use it if you’re one of the following three types of candidates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Creative workers</strong>. The functional resume will give you creative space to highlight your skills. Just remember to add a portfolio for confirmation of your abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Veterans</strong>. Highlighting a detailed military work experience in any other resume format is tricky. Recruiters are usually not familiar with these types of qualifications. Sowing your abilities might be a better idea.</li>
          <li><strong>Overqualified candidates</strong>. Having tons of relevant experience is valuable but often difficult to show on your resume. Sometimes it’s easier to show your skills instead. Especially considering what’s easier for your recruiter to wrap their heads around.</li>

        <h4 style={{ marginLeft: "200px" }}>Combination Resume Format</h4>
        <p>The combination resume format combines elements of a chronological resume and a skills-based resume. It places equal emphasis both on your skills and work experience. The skills summary section lists relevant skills, while the experience section validates them with examples of past accomplishments. </p>
        <p>No matter which resume format you've chosen or whether you’re writing a CV or a resume, make sure it looks good. Here are a few simple resume tips. Follow them, as they will tell you exactly what your resume should look like in 2024.</p>
        <strong>All 10 of the following guidelines apply to all 3 resume formats.</strong>
        <strong>1. Set standard margins</strong>
        <p>Keeping the right resume margin size will boost the readability of your document, making it easier for the recruiter to see that you're the right fit. Making your margins an inch on each side should do the trick. </p>
        <strong>2. Mind the line spacing</strong>
        <p>Giving some white space in between the lines of your resume is another must-do for all candidates to keep their resume readable. Use single or 1.15 line spacing to make your document easier to scan.</p>
        <strong>3. Select a professional font</strong>
        <p>3. Select a professional </p>
        <p>font Choose a 11 or 12-point font that’s easy to read, but also professional-looking. Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Georgia are some of the best fonts for a resume. But don’t be afraid to experiment with more modern, yet still smart, ones. </p>
        <strong>4. Divide your resume into sections</strong>
        <p>You don’t want to have all your details scattered across your resume. Instead, keep your document well organized by creating sections with headings. And add an extra space before and after each section heading, to make reading even easier for your recruiter.</p>
        <strong>5. Apply bullet points</strong>
        <p>Use bullet points for each entry, whether you’re listing your achievements, skills, certificates, or hobbies. That’s a great way of boosting readability and keeping readers interested. Just don’t make them longer than two lines. Three lines are good for full paragraphs, not bullet points.</p>
        <strong>6. Be consistent </strong>
        <p>Consistency is as important as readability. Be consistent with how you show each position, date format, what you bold, what you underline, and what you capitalize. This additionally shows great attention to detail, a skill valued by many employers for many professions.</p>
        <strong>7. Keep the right resume length</strong>
        <p>Aim at having a one-page resume. If you have a lot of experience or tons of skills relevant for the job opening, a two-page resume is also a good idea. Anything above that is different from the right resume length.</p>
        <strong>8. Avoid using photos</strong>
        <p>Don’t use photos on your resume unless the job description specifically asks for them. Companies follow fair hiring practices that are free from bias and discrimination. Quite often, a resume with a picture will be rejected, only for that reason.</p>
        <strong>9. Name your resume correctly</strong>
        <p>Decide on a good name for your resume file. Your name, job title, and the word “resume” will always work great, as it gives the recruiter all the necessary information about this document: who has written it, why this person has written it, and what type of document it is.</p>
        <strong>10. Send your resume as a PDF </strong>
        <p>Sending a PDF resume file, unless stated otherwise in the job description, will allow your document to remain intact, keeping the same structure and length. Plus, PDF format is operable on most devices, so your recruiter can surely access it.</p>
