      <h2>What is the best resume format to use in 2024?</h2>
      <p>A resume consists of several parts. Here's what you should on your resume in 2024:</p>
      <p><strong>The best resume format to use in 2024 is a reverse-chronological resume. It displays your information (e.g., work history and education) from the most recent to the oldest of your qualifications, highlighting the most relevant achievements on your resume.</strong></p>
      <p>However, depending on your career path, you may need to pick:</p><ul style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        <li >Skills-based resume or functional resume: focus on your skills rather than work experience</li>
        <li>Hybrid/combination resume: a clever mix of chronological and functional resumes</li>
        <li>Student resume format: focuses on studies, volunteering work, soft skills, and internships over work history</li>
        <li>Video resume: for creative candidates and industries (must always be accompanied by an actual resume)</li>
        <li>Targeted resume: created with one specific job posting in mind</li>
        <li>Infographic resume: for a career focused on graphics and design skills</li>
        <li>Simple resume: concentrated strictly on the content</li>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Our online resume maker and all of our templates support these resume formats, so you can try them all and see what works best for you!</strong></p>

    <div className="lists" style={{ textAlign: "left", margin: "10px 70px" }}>
      <h2>Do I need a different resume for every different job application?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you do! You should make a different resume for every application. Tailoring your resume to each job you apply to can significantly increase your chances of getting hired. Generic resumes simply don't stand a chance against a targeted resume.</p>
      <p>For an easy way out, check if the job title and skills section match and are relevant to the job you’re after.</p>
      <p>In our resume generator, once you enter the job title you’re pursuing, you’ll get customized suggestions for a list of skills, resume profile, and other areas that can be improved. Also, you can easily duplicate, change, and save every resume you write. That makes it way easier to tailor your resume for each job offer you’re applying for in less than 5 minutes. Now you don't have to mass-send the same resume or spend hours creating a new one for each offer from scratch!</p>
    </div>



    <div className="lists" style={{ textAlign: "left", margin: "10px 70px" }}>
      <h2>What does an ATS-friendly resume mean?</h2>
      <p><strong>An ATS-friendly resume is one that is fully and easily scanned and understood by the Applicant Tracking Systems. Format your resume and include relevant keywords to achieve it.</strong>Many companies use such software to scan and filter resumes before landing on a recruiter’s desk.</p>
      <p>All the templates in Zety resume builder are 100% ATS-compliant. Make your resume using an ATS-friendly resume template, and don’t get rejected.</p>

      <p><strong>Yes, there are many great resume examples! See over 500 free resume examples for any job application. There's a guide for everyone, no matter your experience level and industry.</strong></p>
      <p>However, even though you can copy and use the available examples, it’s still essential to understand what your future employer is looking for in your resume. Use the examples only as references.</p>

    <hr style={{ margin: "70px" }}></hr>
    <div className="lists" style={{ textAlign: "left", margin: "10px 70px" }}>
      <h2>Do I need a cover letter for my resume?</h2>
      <p><strong>Yes, cover letters are necessary. Your recruiters might need more time to read it carefully, but they will find time to scan them when they consider you as a potential hire.</strong></p>
      <p>Submitting a cover letter is one of the best ways to boost your resume and prove just how motivated you are. More than 25% of recruiters consider them critical, and half of them prefer when applicants attach a cover letter to their resume.<strong> Of course, a cover letter will only work if it is as tailored and unique as your resume, so it’s important to figure out what a cover letter should say to wow the recruiter.</strong>
      </p>
